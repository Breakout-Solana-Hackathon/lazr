# LazrPay 

## We help you get paid

Crypto is intimidating for most people as complexity is a major blocker, especially for freelancers, small vendors, or anyone new to crypto. 

LazrPay removes that barrier by offering our clients a secure and easy platform to receive crypto payments to their bank through their email address.

## How it Works?

- Sender pays funds into escrow using an email as identifier
- Recipient verifies their email address
- Recipient claims funds into bank using a 3rd party offramp 

Simple, elegant bridge between the crypto world and day-to-day workers

### Request
